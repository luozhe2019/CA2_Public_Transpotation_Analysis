0,"Bus eireann extremely unreliable Allow a lot of extra time if you need to be on time and avoid for intercounty travel (very slow). Private buses to and from Dublin oversubscribed (Aircoach, Gobus, etc.) and need to be booked in advance. Expressway really overpriced. 

Luas, Dublin Bus, Dart and Irishrail are decent. Irishrail and Dart are a bit outdated",2023-11-18 11:35:41
1,Yeah even in towns like Athlone that got the new electric buses and there’s a town bus that supposed to be going every half hour and yet people are just left standing in the rain not knowing when it will come. It would be nice if they could at least announce bus route cancellations or delays so people could have the chance to make alternative plans rather than waiting for a bus that’s not due to show up for another hour or two.,2023-11-18 14:26:29
2,"Last year I was supposed to get a car service pickup from Dublin Airport to Donegal Town.   The company, Blacklane, bailed on me, sending me a message while I was sitting in the airport.  Fortuantely I remembered that there was a bus that would take me to Donegal town though it took forever to find someone who knew about it.  Once  I got on it for about 20 Euros it was perfectly pleasant.  I took the same bus to Donegal Town again this year.   I've also taken the Feda Bus from Donegal to Galway which is a nice ride.  I've taken the train between Dublin and Galway and Dublin and Killarney and all of these had nice scenery to view on the way.  

I was also able to get around Donegal, which has no rail service, by using a local bus.  I traveled twice to Glencolmcille to take photographs which worked out very well.  

My other favorite place to travel is Newfoundland, and I only wish they had the kind of public transportation that even Donegal has.",2023-11-18 19:33:15
3,"Irish Rail: Good but too overcrowded during peak hours
Dublin Bus: Mixed bag, experience largely depends on the driver if you need assistance

5,"I've been staying in Maynooth for about 2 months on a short study and I've gotten by just fine without a car. I've visited Cork, Sligo, Newry, Dublin, and Glendalough and have plans to visit Galway, Mayo, and Kerry over the next month before I leave, and it's all been via public transport. 

Overall, I find that Irish public transport is poor by European standards but much, much better than what I'm used to back home in Texas. If you're coming to Ireland with a particularly rural itinerary a car is a fine idea but it's by no means a requirement if you just want to see the major cities and tourist spots. Especially for tourists from countries that drive on the right and have predominantly automatic transmissions, I just don't see the need to go through the stress and danger of adapting to a whole new driving system.",2023-11-18 23:13:50
6,I had nothing but good experiences with the one exception of getting to and from the airport in Dublin. Also it's kind of weird that the airport in Kerry was built kind of far from the nearest rail station.,2023-11-18 22:57:03
7,"I personally thought the Irish trains and buses were excellent. Used both in April and May around Dublin to Waterford, Kilkenny, Tramore, Cork, Killarney, Galway, and spots in between. The passengers and  operators were so polite and welcoming. Also, all were very clean.",2023-11-19 00:43:05
8,"If you live outside Dublin and you’re route isn’t on any of the train lines, you’ll realised Bus eireann are very unreliable. Even in cities in Cork when there’s supposed to be a bus every 20 minutes, you can end up waiting an hour or more for a bus that won’t show up. I understand traffic plays a part at certain times but outside peak hours there seems to be an issue with ghost buses.",2023-11-18 14:21:04
9,"Yesterday I was at Spencer Dock luas Station. You can see the final stop (the point) from this station.  The board  said emxt luas in 11 mins then after 11 minutes passed went back up to 8 mins. Then after the 8 mins passed sat at due for another 12 minutes (I was timing it at this stage).

The whole time a luas was sitting at that final stop but never moved and what's more it was joined by another TWO there afterwards.

Sums up public transport in my book",2023-11-18 17:45:26
10,"Maybe I've just been lucky, but I've never had a problem with Bus Eirann. I've used it mainly for the less-busy routes (eg Macroom-West Cork routes),and have loaded up my bicycle in the luggage hold a few times. 
The gems are the Rural West Cork transport shuttles...they are brilliant. Wexford and Waterford have similar shuttles, which I'm looking forward to testing out this summer. And Wexford Bus from Dublin",2023-11-18 21:48:59
11,"I often get the trains on the dublin to cork line. The new rolling stock is comfortable and all of the trains are clean. The old rollingstock that does the full route needs new seats, but again, it is clean. 

All irish rail services seem to be reliable. 

The issues are the speed and lack of onboard services. 

I can drive between dublin and cork in almost the same time as the train journey takes. Once you have added in any travel at either end, it is usually quicker to just drive. 

The wifi needs looked at also as its poor.",2023-11-18 22:36:12
12,The public transport operator in Northern Ireland is Translink if you are heading across the border www.translink.co.uk,2023-11-19 13:58:05
13,"I use public transport quite a lot and it doesn't tend to let me down too much. I think if you are prepared to do a bit of research and adjust your plans then you can have an okay experience, but really we shouldn't be at a point where that has to happen. The government and transport companies look at passenger numbers and think it is as high as can be be, rather than realising that there's a ton of people out there who would use it if they didn't have to wait two hours between services. The same problem is the reason they don't replace connections through the capital with direct services: sure people don't go from Cork to Sligo now, so why bother? It's this attitude that needs to change at all levels of power, otherwise we will be three decades down the road and Dublin will still dominate the country with all the current issues that it brings. Getting any form of public transport between cities is always going to be cheaper than the car, but the car drops you at your house not in a windswept station with no facilities and relying on a connecting service to finish your journey.

Irish Rail is very cheap compared to the UK, the problem is simply one of capacity and frequency. Things like staff, engine and driver numbers will always impose an upper ceiling on things but Irish Rail doesn't seem prepared to ramp up train numbers to bring in any latent demand. They think that the 9pm train being quiet is a reason not to put on an 11pm one, rather than realising that people are simply driving because there's no other option.

The intercity coaches are a good fallback if you need to get somewhere later at night, but my experience of these is solely travelling between Dublin and another city. You might get lucky if you happen to be on the end of a spur, so Limerick to Ennis or Cork to Tralee, or somewhere on the way, like Kildare village, but outside of that you are screwed. That said, I find the intercities are reliable and cheap, but as somebody else said, interacting with the driver on a basic question can drastically change your opinion. I don't know if it's because some services are government-run or because there is a driver shortage and they can get away with it, but the way some speak to passengers who are being polite and asking sensible questions is shocking. I totally understand that there are plenty of arsehole passengers too, but I actually see less of those compared to drivers kicking off.

In the cities the bus problem for me is that they simply don't run late enough, and then you are in the hands of taxi drivers who are openly turning meters off because they are never inspected. Same problem with the Luas and the Dart, which only cover a minority of the city anyway. Again I find the fares cheap, it's like 1.35 or something in Limerick, but I can imagine having to connect between services is no craic. Also I find the bus drivers seem to be much less unhinged than the coach drivers, although I figured they'd have much more reason to hate every passenger they see.

For my pipe dream, I'd have every city north and south connected by a direct service, as well as every university, port and airport. I'd have most of the arterial carriageways and all circular routes in Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Limerick, Derry and Galway have a tramline in the bus lane. Dublin has already re-designed the bus network based on this system. Any major European city, and most of the smaller ones, have this system. Lisbon had a massive tram network right across the oldest parts of town where routes wind around tiny hillside streets, the particular trams are smaller in those parts but even Porto, Prague, Cologne, Milan and Stockholm all have this. I've never used the rental bikes and scooters as I have my own and live in a small city, but I see plenty of young people and loads of tourists using them, probably a good alternative to ramming a bike into a one-bedroom apartment. I'd also personally collect and bury every single Leap card at the bottom of the sea and replace it with a contactless system that is seamless between services, meaning you get off a bus and onto a bike within 90 minutes and it is a single charge. 

We have to be serious about climate change but even if you don't give a shit about that, these are all things that exist in plenty of other places that we like to group ourselves into, and plenty of others we don't. For a small country with no major environmental challenges of freak weather events to contend with, as well as a massive budget surplus to spend, we should have a significant headstart on most other places, but we're crippled by parochialism, short-termism and a lack of strategic thinking. There's finally work being done on a rail link between Limerick and Foynes, and it only seemed to get over the line because they don't want rich Americans stuck in traffic for the Ryder Cup. The operator at Foynes and the EU was pleading with the government to re-open the line, and when they finally decided to, they forgot to survey the part of the line that goes to the cement factory. We're talking 2 or 3km of track that could take major freight traffic off the road, but as usual everyone thought it was somebody else's problem.",2023-11-21 09:00:55
14,A lot of people who think dublin public transport is bad have never been to similarly sized cities in the US. Compared to them you’d wonder why anyone drives here,2023-11-18 12:02:34
15,"If you're flying in internationally, your carbon footprint for the holiday starts off high anyway. Just throwing that in the mix. 

The thing with public transport is that it's not designed, the routes, for tourism. It likes the large urban centres, patchily sure, but if you want to get to say, the Cliff of Moher it doesn't do that easily.

Public transport requires time. Time that a lot of people on short vacations can't afford. Hell, we also tell them not to try drive the entire country in 4 days too because there's a balance, as in all things. 

Also, accessibility. Coach buses that traverse the country every day have either no, or extremely limited accessibility, so if you've a mobility issue, or a bladder issue tbh, coach transport can be really hit or miss. The trains don't go everywhere, can be overcrowded and at times, fucking expensive for what you're getting and while the trains themselves have way better accessibility, getting on and off them, and out of the stations even can prove very challenging for wheelchair users or people with ambulatory restrictions. 

Taxis, again, accessible taxis are few and far between. And if you have to go far in one, that's the cost of a car rent far the day even. 

Public transport is a great way to move a lot of people, but they also aren't the best way for everyone. 

So everyone needs to evaluate their needs, wants, time and budgets to go with the options that work best for them.",2023-11-18 11:50:35
16,"I would highly advise against using public transport in Ireland for a number of reasons.


**1. Expensive**
In comparison to other EU countries, it's ridiculously expensive. The train costs €22.50 to get from Dublin to Westport (probably more now) - in comparison, in France, you can travel a similar distance near Montpellier for €1. Buses here are also crazy expensive compared to the rest of Europe. It costs more to travel from Shannon Airport to Galway than it does to take a flight from Spain to Ireland.


**2. Lack of Quality**
I took a bus two weeks ago, there was one empty row at the back, when I got there, the entire seat was broken and pulled away from the back. You'll find the depths in the windows covered in years of dirt, not to mention the smell of shite. The same goes for trains. You'll have a sore arse after an hour journey.

**3. No Country for Students**
The NTA (The Irish body for national transport) recently banned all student cards for travelling, allowing only a special paid card which cannot be availed of by any student outside of Ireland (and many within Ireland, because lots of universities have recently changed their name and the system hasn't updated it). It's a 100% reduction. Ireland is the only country I've come across, which doesn't offer a student discount for international visitors.


**4. Loud Passengers**
Public transport in Ireland is unique in comparison to the rest of Europe, in that loud noise is generally accepted. One of the biggest changes for me living in another country coming from Ireland is how quiet public transport (in particular trains) was.


**5. Never on Time**
Public transport in Ireland is never on time, I have literally never taken a bus or train that arrived and departed on the time it was meant to. Generally, it's 20 minutes on either side of the expected time. Drivers don't give a shite, I was once on a bus which was an hour late and the driver got off to get a takeaway halfway through the journey.",2023-11-18 23:16:08
17,"Besides the train, everything else is late, overcrowded and insufficient. Personally, the bus should be free if it's more than 10 minutes late and if it's full, send another fucking bus out. The amount of times I have stood in the pissing rain only for a bus to show up 30 minutes late to tell me I can't come on because it's full. Waiting in line at the literal station in the pissing rain, only for some driver (20 minutes after we're supposed to leave) to waltz out slower than a sloth as if the world revolves around him. It might be great in Dublin but there's an entire country outside of Dublin unfortunately and we get shafted constantly.",2023-11-18 13:38:18

22,"Fair I thought but you can mostly get over the overcrowding on Irish rail by pre booking a seat. Occasionally you’ll find your pre booked seat occupied but they will normally mooch off when you point out that you have it booked and for me yes the Luas needs to be more frequent and they need to manage anti social behaviour better but otherwise it’s fine if limited in reach. Personally I think the Dart is fine, it’s short duration transit- the fact its a bit dated doesn’t bother me any more than the fact that my underground carriage in London might be 40 years old",2023-11-18 11:19:12

28,"Excellent points, well made thank you mod!

In response to some of the above comments, my purpose here was to get past a simplistic “Don’t even bother looking at public transport in Ireland” narrative which is wrong” to a nuanced and informative discussion of where it might be a useful option to consider.

On the carbon issue, the carbon impact of seven million plus visitors arriving is fixed (no other way for say North American visitors to get here for example) but the impact while here is at least partially an impact of the transit choices they make while they are here. 

I still maintain that trains are good value- in my experience the cost for a couple of a journey between cities is usually comparable or less than driving your own car when you factor fuel, wear and tear and tolls and significantly less than hiring a car but as you say, it only gets you so far and starts to fall down badly when exploring many of our most popular sights like the Ring of Kerry, Connemara and the Cliffs of Moher. 

I just wanted to put out there (acknowledging the very valid points you make about those with more limited mobility) that you can cover a lot and have a very enjoyable experience using trains to move between cities and then selecting some well chosen day tours by tourism oriented operators or by hiring a car locally to access the harder to reach spots.",2023-11-18 12:17:30
29,"I’ve done the Cliffs by public transport in a day from Dublin. It’s actually quite doable from Dublin, Limerick and Galway (maybe even Cork, I don’t know). The bus to/from the cliffs isn’t very frequent but it’s often enough to allow a day trip. I’ve even done Aran Islands as a day trip from Dublin. I don’t know what planet people live on thinking these places are unreachable by public transport",2023-11-18 14:51:49
30,"I would add to this very well made point that renting a car in Ireland has the enormous advantage that you can actually enjoy the countryside, stop at a random farm selling honey, reach that remote cliff or viewpoint, or that remotely located pub, without worrying that you won't have a bus to go back to your hotel or that you'd have to wait for X hours for one. Even reaching some B&Bs would not be possible without a car. The railway network is extremely limited in Ireland (in fact we had a larger network a century ago), so bus is the only option. Driving the small rural roads dotted with sheep is an experience in itself, and the cost of renting is also not so bad if sharing between 3-4 people and outside of summer months, in fact it can end up being cheaper than a train.",2023-11-18 14:45:51
31,Added in an overview of the main transportation resources in the main post which might be useful to pin perhaps,2023-11-19 10:56:23
32,"You’re obviously entitled to your opinion here but some fact checking on your points:

Cost- It would seem your experience of fares is somewhat out of date.

 A ticket on the SNCF website from Montpellier to Toulouse (slightly shorter distance to Dublin to Westport ) costs €15 to €38 depending on time of day. Dublin to Westport has been priced at €16 for some
time and is available on all trains if booked in advance.

Students- overseas full time students are entitled to apply for a student leap card just as Irish students are which gives significant discounts (50%) and it only costs €5 so it would most likely pay for itself in first journey.
A little overhead in collecting it, admittedly (you have to show eligibility documentation to  a Leap card agent) but there was a perception that student cards were being abused previously (I know some night students who applied for and use them for example) so they have obviously tightened up on their issue.


 https://about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch#eligible. 

I have family members who just started studying in a number of the universities who recently changed name (SETU, ATU, TUS) and they all had their student leap cards up and running a few weeks into term. 

Punctuality- you may have been extraordinarily unlucky but average punctuality on the Irish rail intercity network (defined as arriving within 10 mins of schedule) is currently averaging about 92% with reliability close to 100%. Buses as a number of posters have noted are considerably less reliable and punctual.",2023-11-19 04:07:50
33,Tried what exactly?,2023-11-18 18:57:48
34,"There are massive capacity issues on some Irish rail trains e.g. Galway-Heuston service. The middle carriages will be packed full of people and then you have lots of seats booked by travel pass holders, particularly this time of year. 

Dated doesn't really bother me on the Dart either but some of the carriages are in awful shape. Some of the underground trains are very dated but it's a far superior service to anything we have here.

Also, for tourists, public transport isn't that important unless you're just going to stay in Dublin. Most people will just rent a car as we have a disjointed public transport network. MetroNorth will solve some of the problem but it won't dent the car rental market at Dublin airport IMO.",2023-11-18 11:49:30
35,"We purchased day of and day before most rides. Got everything online and at the station for the bus from Waterford to Cork City. What impressed me was that bus passengers always said thank you to the driver. In US, drivers sometimes get shot by the passengers.",2023-11-19 02:57:55

37,"I think the train service has certainly improved in the last year and to be fair, they have always maintained a tight schedule. By far it's the best form of wheelchair accessible travel, I know some stations are inaccessible and there's issues with ramps to get onto the train but the staff are excellent and do their best, plus there's a whole series of issues with the size of our railway guage that would pose challenges for fully accessibility. Now, Bus Eireann, as one poster rightly pointed out, can and is a fucking nightmare. Terrible accessibility outside of big towns and cities, they keep buying those stupid coaches with several steps in them. They're not practical for our rural roads and they give nonsense about needing the space for luggage. They gave attempted to buy coaches with fucking stupid lifts for wheelchair users that are overly complicated for the driver and wastes everyone's time instead of a simple pull out ramp. 

Citylink do a much better job, but I still believe in public transport, we have to use it and I hope we see more of it and more ease of access for people to use it. 

It's fucking embarrassing though that we have zero proper rail connection to Dublin airport, some shite private bus company (inaccessible in reality, some nonsense about a on board lift). Even Tallinn, a much smaller city, has a tram to the airport.",2023-11-18 15:06:26

42,"Excuse me, can you do a little more research before you ""fact check"" because you're wrong on a lot of things here.

Also, Irish Rail doesn't offer a flat rate of €16, looking at the trains right now, the closest one is €18 which is still ridiculously expensive compared to the rest of Europe.

Regarding the Student Leap Card, to apply online, you have to enter a university that is on its system. Unfortunately, this is impossible for non-Irish residents as it doesn't recognise universities outside of Ireland. It doesn't even recognise my university, which is Irish, and has changed its name recently. Plus you have to collect the card from an agent which is only available in big cities, which makes it impossible for international visitors. Again, Ireland is the only country in Europe that I'm aware of such ridiculous restrictions.

Intercity is obviously going to run on better punctuality because of the short distance of journeys. Come back to me with figures on punctuality on rural transport and we'll talk.",2023-11-19 12:11:45

Most times I’ve used the train, it’s been slow, packed and late. Would be quicker to drive between Galway and Dublin than take the train. 

The last bus eireann I took was 35 mins late for pickup (there was no explanation at the bus station and no indication about what time it was arriving) . Good job I wasn’t under pressure to arrive in my destination at a specific time. 

Dublin bus was hit and miss. Busses were dirty. To be expected in a city maybe but the last bus I was on looked like it had never been cleaned since it first went into service. 

There was a general lack of integration between the different forms of public transport. Maybe this has improved since the Luas was introduced (I’ve not had the pleasure yet). 

Irish public transport is very poor compared to other countries such as Sweden. I’m sure there are many other European countries which we could look towards for top quality public transport services at a decent price.",2023-11-18 20:47:56

It will indicate the satisfaction with the other local provider who remains that they are known locally as ShittyLink though personally I’ve found them ok if very slow compared to trains.

They do sometimes arrive late to intermediate stations but they generally seem to make it up by the time they reach the destination.
 That’s broadly reflected in the punctuality stats from Irish Rail noted in the main post, with anything more than 10 mins reported as unpunctual. And driving time for the route per Google maps is equivalent at 2.5 hours to the train time.

56,I read in another thread the bus back to Galway from the cliffs is frequently just so packed there is a chance not everyone will make it. True or not?,2023-11-19 01:16:55

59,The trains run a bit later Monday- Saturday in fairness. Last one leaving Galway is 1920 but totally agree it’s not very practical especially as the first train arrives a half an hour after the first bus leaves,2023-11-18 20:33:57
60,"I don’t have personal experience of that route but unfortunately it can sometimes happen that a bus arrives at an intermediate stop and is already full. I don’t know if it would help but on the assumption that most tourists using public transport travel from Dublin to Galway and Galway to the Cliffs/ Doolin, the bus route then continues to Ennis from the Cliffs so (I’m theorising here now, don’t know for sure if this is true) possibly the bus may be less busy going south from the Cliffs to Ennis. 

So an option might be to get train (slightly less convenient than the Galway train) to Ennis and buck the trend by getting the bus North, and on your return head south to Ennis unfortunately you’ll miss the Burren which is on the bus journey north from Doolin to Galway and very memorable scenery in my view.  Another possible option would be Dublin Galway (train) Doolin/Cliffs by bus, bus to Ennis and train back to Dublin from Ennis which at least avoids the risk that say the bus to Galway in Doolin has already filled up at the Cliffs. That route through Ennis would set you up well to head to Killarney or Cork if that was part of your itinerary.

As I say you’d need to get someone with personal experience to confirm this. You could always ring Ennis or Galway Bus station for advice as well.",2023-11-19 13:20:08
